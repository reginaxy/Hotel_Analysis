              Topic modeling is a text processing technique, which is aimed at overcoming information overload by seeking out and \
              demonstrating patterns in textual data, 
              identified as the 'topics'. It enables an improved user experience, allowing analysts to navigate quickly through a \
              corpus of text or a collection, guided by identified topics.\n
              **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** is a popular topic modelling approach to extract themes from a corpus. 
              The phrase "latent" refers to something that is hidden or concealed.
              The themes we'd want to extract from the data are "hidden topics". As a result, the term "latent" is used in LDA. 

              The challenges of Topic Modelling is to extract good quality of topics that are clear, segregated and meaningful. \
              This depends heavily on the quality of text preprocessing and the strategy of finding the optimal number of topics.\n

              **Two fundamental assumptions are made by the LDA:**\n
              1. Documents are made up of a variety / mixture of topics \n
              2. Each topic are made up of a number of words

          In short, **Topic Modelling** is a text mining approach to find common subjects in texts. \
          Topic modelling can connect words with similar meanings together, \
          and distinguish between usage of words with numerous meanings by assigning them to different topics. \n

          The main **disadvantage** of topic modelling is the need for humans to interpret the topics themselves. \
          Although the model will display the keywords present in each specific topic, humans will still need to \
          identify the most important keywords in each topic, \
          then make logical and reasonable inferences based on the keywords identified.\n

          Upon observing the keywords in all the topics, the 10 most mentioned subjects in the reviews were identified, as follows: \n

          1. **Room size / Comfort related** - Keywords: bed, comfy, cozy, cosy, pillow, mattress, uncomfort, 
          airconditioning, size, space, family, luxury, twin, executive\n

          2. **Bathroom related** - Keywords:  bathroom, floor, shower, bath, water, toiletry, sink, slipper\n

          3. **Room view related** - Keywords: view, balcony\n

          4. **Facility related** - Keywords: facility, furniture, wardrobe, kettle, coffee, milk, tea, pool, facility, fridge, cup, parking\n

          5. **Service related** - Keywords: staff, service, reception, helpful, polite, desk, concierge, efficient, kind, customer, receptionist\n

          6. **Food / Dining related** - Keywords: breakfast, dinner, buffet, choice,fruit , reservation, restaurant, food, cafe, selection, option\n

          7. **Stay Experience related** - Keywords: noise, problem, smell, control, temperature, light, hear, sound, loud, construction, street\n

          8. **Nightlife related** - Keywords: drink, lounge, cocktail, bar, beer\n

          9. **Location / Accessiblity related** - Keywords: location, area, station, metro, proximity, walk, tube, tram, train, access, bus, 
          car, convenient, attraction, airport, distance, taxi, public, transport\n

          10. **Internet related** - Keywords: wifi, internet, connect
